## Description
Icarus Eye is built using a custom YOLOv8s model trained on the VisDrone2019-DET Dataset. This project is a semester 
project for a Machine Vision course at KSU. The project aims to be a proof of concept for real-time object detection and
tracking using a drone. The project is built using Python, OpenCV, and PyTorch. The project is built to be modular and
customizable, allowing for easy integration with other models and datasets. The project's name is a pun and a reference 
to the Greek myth of Icarus, who flew too close and fell, and the vigilant Eye of Sauron from the Lord of the Rings.
